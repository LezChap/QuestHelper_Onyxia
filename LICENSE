QuestHelper wouldn't exist if not for all the useful libraries and example code that exists. As a result, various parts of QuestHelper are licensed under a variety of licenses.

Libraries:

AstrolabeQH/* - LGPL v2.1, much thanks to Esamynn
ChatThrottleLib/* - All rights reserved, by Mikk. I am assuming that embedding is OK, as the library is useless otherwise, but will remove the library if requested.
LibAboutPanel/* - All rights reserved, by Ackis. I am assuming that embedding is OK, as the library is useless otherwise, but will remove the library if requested.

QH files:

error.lua - LGPL v3.0, heavily based on Swatter code from Norganna

All of the following files are LGPL v3.0, based on the original 0.48 QuestHelper code:
comm.lua
custom.lua
dodads.lua
flightpath.lua
graph.lua
help.lua
hidden.lua
lang.lua
main.lua
mapbutton.lua
menu.lua
nag.lua

QuestHelper.toc
questlog.lua
recycle.lua
routing.lua

All other files are (c) Ben Wilhelm, all rights reserved. This includes, but is not limited to:

core.lua
collect.lua
tooltip.lua
collect_*.lua
routing_*.lua
manager_*.lua
director_*.lua
db_*.lua

All of these files have very restricted interfaces, making them suitable for inclusion in an otherwise LGPL codebase. If you feel that the coupling between the closed-sourced and LGPL sections are too broad, please let me know what I can do to improve things.
