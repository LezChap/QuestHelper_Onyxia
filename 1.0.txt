first let's implement a fucking arrow



Routing core module. Functions:

-- Construction: Distance function, new-path notification function

Process()

NodeAdd(loc)
NodeRemove(loc)
NodeObsoletes(loc1, loc2)
NodeRequires(loc1, loc2)
-- We'll have Node Value in here later

DistanceSet(loc1, loc2) -- this is for a "hard" distance, where it's computed more exactly
DistanceClear()




Coordinator has similar functions:

-- Construction: Soft distance function, hard distance function, new-path notification function

Process()

NodeAdd(loc, tier)
NodeRemove(loc)
NodeObsoletes(loc1, loc2)
NodeRequires(loc1, loc2)




-- Other things:
* Some way to obsolete paths in various manners. "Hard" and "Soft" distances.
