first let's implement a fucking arrow



Routing core module. Functions:

-- Construction: Distance function, new-path notification function

Process()

NodeAdd(loc)
NodeRemove(loc)
NodeObsoletes(loc1, loc2)
NodeRequires(loc1, loc2)
-- We'll have Node Value in here later

DistanceSet(loc1, loc2) -- this is for a "hard" distance, where it's computed more exactly
DistanceClear()




Coordinator has similar functions:

-- Construction: Soft distance function, hard distance function, new-path notification function

Process()

NodeAdd(loc, tier)
NodeRemove(loc)
NodeObsoletes(loc1, loc2)
NodeRequires(loc1, loc2)




-- Other things:
* Some way to obsolete paths in various manners. "Hard" and "Soft" distances.



Versions:

RC: Public release candidate
Beta: public beta
Alpha: comments public alpha
Prealpha: SA thread
pre2alpha: #webcomics, anyone who asks, friends, det"ox
pre3alpha: very limited people




--------------------------------------------

I'm writing this a few hours after the no-more-donation thing took effect.

I may as well write stuff I planned here, just for record. It'd be good to get it out of my brain, since it's not doing any good in here anymore.

* Pathfinding around obstacles. I've got some very nice maps of the entire world, with obstacles clearly marked.
* Routing based on future, unclaimed quests. I'd need to figure out how quest chains work for this, of course, but I think that's doable - store a list of everything the user does quest-related. If a user turns in a quest and then picks up another set immediately, that's a sign that B may chain off A. Go from there.
* Automatically find upgrades. I've been storing info on when people switch equipment, and what they switch to. I might be able to turn that into a guide for easy upgrades, and, of course, I can direct people to the appropriate quests easily.
* Built-in Wowhead. Should be doable. Should be easy. Why hasn't anyone done it? ('Cause of the ads, I suppose.)
* Built-in forums. You'd need a client for this one. But it would be cool.
* Achievements, of course.
* Automatically restock ammo and reagents.
* Automatically send you to a vendor or mailbox to sell or mail things.
* Track dailies that you need to do each day, and route you between them.
* A spinning arrow! Of my own! That doesn't suck!
* Highlighted zones where monsters/drops can be found, rather than just a set of glowspots
* API for third-party extensions
