* Bug: QH:ComputeTravelTime is not taking the "last leg" from the zone entry point to the destination into account when doing path optimization
* Bug: AddObjectiveBest is not adding objectives in the best place in any sense of the word
* Bug: Explicit allocation. Seriously. This is a bug. IT IS IDIOTIC. WHY DID YOU DO THIS. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING.
* Bug: Aaaargh wacky custom half-classes with no abstraction (eats own face, dies)
