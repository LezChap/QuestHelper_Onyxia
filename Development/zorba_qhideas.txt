* Bug: QH:ComputeTravelTime is not taking the "last leg" from the zone entry point to the destination into account when doing path optimization
* Bug: AddObjectiveBest is not adding objectives in the best place in any sense of the word
* Bug: Explicit allocation. Seriously. This is a bug. IT IS IDIOTIC. WHY DID YOU DO THIS. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING.
* Bug: Aaaargh wacky custom half-classes with no abstraction (eats own face, dies)

* Bug: ObjectiveTravelTime2 is obviously inconsistent with ComputeTravelTime2, also what the hell is it doing

* Custom handling for complex quests that QH currently kind of fails on ("collect these items, then use this to combine them, then give it to me" which invariably only gives you the second part at some random place in the world)
