* Check out PTR, with flight points
* Build!

* Routing recovery
* Fix the flight paths
* Routing infinite-loop test (and kill)
* Serifize it again on PTR, I miss the serifs :(
* Build!

* New data storage
* Build!

@ Remember priorities
@ "Too Tough For Me" button

@ See if it can be made faster, re-enable sanity checks on at least some level
* Re-enable asserts in general, ha ha

* Rebuild build system
  * Re-enabled "zero nodes"
  
* Rebuild routing

* BUGS
* Record drops per-instance so we don't think both Kael'Thas'es are the same
* Rig static.lua to break if it doesn't load or has a version mismatch
* Lots of things break when flightpoints are updated. Lots of them.
* Cartographer 3 incompatibility?
* Bug: Full info in Tomtom's waypoint line?
* Bug: The assert check is going to break if the flightpoints are updated. Make this not happen. Actually now that I think about it, I bet updating the flight points is causing a lot of those crashes!
QuestHelper: The Routing Co-Routine just exploded:
Interface\Addons\Questhelper\objective.lua:30: stack overflow
* The only annoying thing I've run into so far is the cartographer arrow not showing up until you do /qh cartwp twice which has always been there. 
* "Hide" does not function properly when entering instances.
* Incompatible with Mapster?

@ Flying mounts
@ Tunable not-in-group penalties
* Build!

* Better data collection - collect more from more people, prompt them to upload once they have a good chunk of data
* Track player paths
* Track quest-item drops only when quest is still unfinished
* Track monster spots in a more specific fashion
* Track quest XP
* Track quest followups?
@ Teleporters functional?
  @ Mage teleport
  @ Druid teleport
  @ Hearthstone?
* Build!

* Bug: QH:ComputeTravelTime is not taking the "last leg" from the zone entry point to the destination into account when doing path optimization
* Bug: AddObjectiveBest is not adding objectives in the best place in any sense of the word
* Bug: Explicit allocation. Seriously. This is a bug. IT IS IDIOTIC. WHY DID YOU DO THIS. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING.
* Bug: Aaaargh wacky custom half-classes with no abstraction (eats own face, dies)

* Bug: ObjectiveTravelTime2 is obviously inconsistent with ComputeTravelTime2, also what the hell is it doing
* Bug: Crash bug on timed quests?

* Flavor: include the name of the boat/zeppelin
* Remove all those wacky random-enchant items from the drop tables
* Switch to GUIDs if we haven't already
* Less reset-pathing-information, seriously wtf
* Show what you should be doing when you're at a flight point

* Better geography and barriers
  * Pick this up automatically after "better data collection"?
* Higher cost for traveling through high-level areas?

* Custom handling for complex quests that QH currently kind of fails on ("collect these items, then use this to combine them, then give it to me" which invariably only gives you the second part at some random place in the world)

* Monster spawn zones should be more obvious, not just a few "go here" spots that you can't see simultaneously without a non-obvious UI feature
* Drop rates for quests

* Quest followups added automatically
* "Quest-like" things
  * Recipes
  * Flight paths
  * Weapon training
  * Skill training
  * Automatic reagent/ammo restocking
  * Repairs
  * Mounts
  * Pick-up dailies?
* Add "get quest"?

* Loose prioritization
* Give some priority to turning in quests
* Tracking "leveling" as part of the route finder (ha ha oh god)
  * Along with training, mounts
  * What the hell let's toss reagents and repairs in here as well :D :D :D

* Separate CPU-usage multiplier for
  * Combat
  * City
  * PvP
  * World
  * Instance

*** Unsorted

* Auto-/target script?
* Track/infer completed quests
* Display more vertically? Is this even possible?
