A variety of steps! Each one needs an input file and a predictable output location.

* 1: Download (no input file)
* 2: Decompress to inputfilename/hash.lua
* 3: Collate into hash.lua
* 4: Cull and upgrade into inputfilename/hash.lua (if the cull fails, just create an empty inputfilename)
* 5: Collate right back into hash.lua
* 6: Rename into inputfilename/UID_timestamp.lua
* 7: Combine into UID/timestamp.lua
* 8: Cull into UID/timestamp.lua with only the most recent allowed
* 9: Collate into UID.lua
* 10: Dump into binary data
* 11: Process!
