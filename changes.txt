== Version 0.11; Uploaded 12/01/2007 ==

* Wrote functions for creating menus. There seems to be some horrible bug related to recycling them, but I can't figure it out and I'm not going to worry about it for now. You can drag them around by their title or right click on their title to close them.
* You can right click on an objective on the world map to create a menu for it, and from that menu you can request that it be ignored for forced to the beginning for the route.
* For the people that couldn't zoom out of the map, that might have been fixed, too.

== Version 0.10; Uploaded 11/30/2007 ==

* Will ignore quests you're probably not capable of doing.
* Minimap arrow should now unhide itself when entering/leaving an instance or continent.
* Asking for the same objective twice will remove it.
* Route objectives contain an array of distances to nearby nodes, but they weren't being updated with the world graph. If new nodes were created, pathing would break when it tried to do math on a value that didn't exist.

== Version 0.9; Uploaded 11/29/2007 ==

* If you put the mouse over the an objective on the world map, all known locations for it will be highlighted on the map.
* Wrote a script to generate the zip file for me, which will save me from having to delete the unneeded bits each time, and also hopefully ensure that the directory structure remains sane.
* The player's position wasn't being updated while flying. When the player landed, it would think you were still where you took off from, think that was where you flew to, and crash and burn when it discovered that that wasn't one of the possible flight routes you could have taken.
* The routing co-routine will perform no more than 5 pathing operations per frame. Should prevent performance from degrading with lots of objectives.

== Version 0.8; Uploaded 11/27/2007 ==

* User waypoints can be created by typing '/find <what you want>'. Begin with the word "item", "npc", or "loc" to only search for things in those categories. If you don't say what you want, it'll search everything it knows of. Locations can be prefixed with a zone name, to add the location in that zone instead of your current one. All text is compared using Levenshtein distance, so it should be able to handle typos and partial matches. It also makes it slow as hell. At the moment, you can't remove objectives or force them to be first, so this is almost useless.
* If an item can be purchased, it will always suggest this. No more telling you to kill the people you talk to, just because they were on your route and killing them is faster than walking to the vendor.
* Fixed bug with graph searching code, distance traveled was getting overwritten even when the fitness wasn't better.
* Routing us now done using A* pathfinding instead of straight line distances. Actually, that's a lie, my herustic isn't working properly, so until I fix it, it's technically Dijkstra's algorithm. But the point is, it should be able make more intelligent decisions now.
* The arrow on the minimap now points to the next place you should visit instead of directly at the next objective. So it might, for example, direct you towards a flight master.
* Graph nodes that got merged due to their proximity sometimes didn't appear in all the zones they should have.
* When a graph node was shared by more than one zone, and an objective could be completed in either of them, that node would be searched for twice, and couldn't be found the second time.
* Most of the internals have been rewritten, so odds are good that if something was broken before, it will work now. Of course, the reverse is equally true. So, cross your fingers.


== Version 0.7; Uploaded 11/21/2007 ==

* Started work on pathing, which is used on the world map display. Routing is still using straight line distance between objectives though, as I haven't programmed a proper heuristic for it yet, and I'm worried about performance.
* Records information about flight masters, and keeps track of flight times between locations. Note that for a flight point to get considered in pathing, you need to talk to the flight master there.
* Records the locations where two zones join together when you walk over the edge, for use in pathing.
* Tooltips for objectives on the world map now include travel time estimates. Naturally, that doesn't include the time required for killing monsters and collecting items, or using mounts, swimming through water, obstacle avoidance, or anything else that'll affect your speed.
* In the static data, quests without hashed objective text no longer get replaced by quests that do. Incomplete quests were hiding the imported quest data, so QuestHelper didn't know where to hand them in.

== Version 0.6; Uploaded 11/18/2007 ==

* Due to a bug fallback quest information wasn't getting found. Now that it's fixed, it can now tell you where to hand quests in.
* Fixed the bug with the vendor item objectives.
* The dots on the world map are now spaced evenly.

== Version 0.5; Uploaded 11/18/2007 ==

* Redid the routing.
* Fix a bug with the unneeded red dots not getting hidden, and littering the world map. 

== Version 0.4; Uploaded 11/17/2007 ==

* Includes a lot more quest information, which was mostly imported from LightHeaded and EQL3.
* Item gathering objectives should be working.
* I think there's a bug in the routing, but I'll worry about that later. 

== Version 0.3; Uploaded 11/17/2007 ==

* Discovered that quest items are often returned to you, resulting in QuestHelper thinking you can acquire then from the same place you finish the quest.
* Due to the above change, routing doesn't understand the way the data is organized now, so quests that involve gathering items are broken.

== Version 0.2; Uploaded 11/16/2007 ==

* Now parse objectives involving reputation correctly, although I'm not tracking reputation changes from kills yet.
* Keeping track of what vendors sell what items.
* Hashed quest text, so I have some way to tell quests with the same name apart.
* I think I fixed the bug with the empty item objectives. 

== Version 0.1; Uploaded 11/15/2007 ==

* Replaces the AddOn 'TravelingTomTom', and dropped TomTom as a dependency.
